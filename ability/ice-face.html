<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Pokémon's ice head can take a physical attack as a substitute, but the attack also changes the Pokémon's appearance. The ice will be restored when it hails.</p>

<p>There are no Pokémon with this ability. (It's probably a Gen 8 ability that's snuck its way into the database by mistake.)</p>
