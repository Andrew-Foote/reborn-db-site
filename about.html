<h1>About this website</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a fan of Pokémon Reborn and I also like making websites. The Pokémon Reborn Database is a sub-site of my <a href="https://andrew-foote.github.io">personal website</a>.</p>

  <h2>Something is broken! / I have a suggestion!</h2>
  
<p>Probably the best way to let me know about something like this is to create a <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Foote/reborn-db-site/issues">GitHub issue</a>. You will need to create a GitHub account though. Otherwise you can DM me on Reddit&mdash;my username is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/house_carpenter/">house_carpenter</a>&mdash;although if I'm getting a bunch of requests for the same thing, I might not respond.</p>

  <h2>Can I download your data?</h2>
  
<p>The data has been extracted from the files in the Pokémon Reborn installation. So in a sense, assuming you've downloaded Pokémon Reborn, you already have the data. But I wrote some Python code to collect all this data into a more manageable form, specifically a SQLite database. A copy of the database is available for download from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18po9y19qKWbhLYRJQaLWtLl1hnvCeahJ/view">here</a> although I can't guarantee that it will always be up-to-date with this website as I have to remember to update it separately from the code. Another approach if you have some coding skills would be to download the code behind the site from <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Foote/reborn-db">here</a>, and use that to build the database (it only requires a Pokémon Reborn installation to be present on your computer), although I haven't really documented the code very well.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd just provide the database file from a page on this website, but unfortunately my current hosting provider (GitHub Pages) doesn't work well with such large files. (It's only about 100 megabytes, which is very small for a database, but still a bit too large for GitHub Pages.) Finding a better hosting solution is on my to-do list.</p>
