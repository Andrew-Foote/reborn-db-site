<h1>About this website</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a fan of Pokémon Reborn and I also like making websites. The Pokémon Reborn Database is a sub-site of my <a href="https://andrew-foote.github.io">personal website</a>.</p>

  <h2>Something is broken! / I have a suggestion!</h2>
  
<p>Probably the best way to let me know about something like this is to create a <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Foote/reborn-db-site/issues">GitHub issue</a>. You will need to create a GitHub account though. Otherwise you can DM me on Reddit&mdash;my username is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/house_carpenter/">house_carpenter</a>&mdash;although if I'm getting a bunch of requests for the same thing, I might not respond.</p>

  <h2>Can I download your data?</h2>
  
<p>Most of the data has been extracted from the files in the Pokémon Reborn installation. So in a sense, assuming you've downloaded Pokémon Reborn (otherwise, why are you looking at this website?), you already have the data. But I wrote some Python code to collect all this data into a more manageable form, specifically a SQLite database; you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/Andrew-Foote/reborn-db">here</a>. You can use this code on your own Pokémon Reborn installation to build the database, although I haven't really documented how it works yet (it's on my to-do list) so for now you'll just have to figure it out yourself.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd just provide the database file here for you to download, but unfortunately my current hosting provider (GitHub Pages) doesn't work well with such large files. (It's only about 75 megabytes, which is very small for a database, but still a bit too large for GitHub Pages.) Finding a better hosting solution is on my to-do list.</p>
